/**
 * SAD at-rest encryption — dev-mode AES-128-ECB helpers.
 *
 * In production the SAD blob is encrypted via AWS KMS (`KMS_SAD_KEY_ARN`
 * on the data-prep service) and decrypted with the KMS DecryptCommand —
 * the stored ciphertext is KMS's self-describing CiphertextBlob.
 *
 * In local dev, e2e, and pre-Phase-2 staging we don't want to provision a
 * KMS key just to let the provisioning pipeline exercise itself.  We
 * instead AES-128-ECB encrypt the SAD bytes under a static stub master key
 * (sixteen 0x00 bytes), PKCS#7 padded.  Raw ciphertext bytes go straight
 * into the Postgres Bytes column — no base64 at rest — and the RCA
 * service decrypts with the matching helper before shipping plaintext to
 * the PA applet over TRANSFER_SAD.
 *
 * sadKeyVersion tells the reader which regime applies:
 *   0 → AWS KMS envelope (prod)
 *   1 → AES-128-ECB under DEV_SAD_MASTER_KEY (dev/e2e/staging)
 *
 * This module lives in @vera/emv so both data-prep (encrypt) and rca
 * (decrypt) can import it without cross-service dependencies.  It is NEVER
 * used in prod — the data-prep service only calls the dev path when
 * KMS_SAD_KEY_ARN is unset, and prod deployments always set that ARN.
