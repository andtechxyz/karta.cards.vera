 * The mobile app (build-time) and server-side (runtime) both read the
 * same env var so a single ops change propagates everywhere.
 *
 * Env var:
 *   ADMIN_EMAIL_ALLOWLIST  (CSV, case-insensitive)
 *     e.g. "alice@karta.cards,bob@karta.cards"
 *
 * Empty / unset → empty list.  Callers MUST treat an empty list as
 * "no admins configured"; server-side routes should reject all traffic
 * in that state rather than silently allowing everyone through.
