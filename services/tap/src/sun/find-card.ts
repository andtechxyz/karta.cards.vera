// Resolve a cardRef-less SUN URL (e.g. the mobile app's `/api/tap/verify/:urlCode`
// path) to a specific Card by trial-deriving its meta-read key from each
// candidate's stored UID and attempting PICC decrypt.  The "match" signal is
// the SDM tag byte (0xC7) at plaintext offset 0 — every other key produces
// effectively-random bytes there with probability 1/256.
//
// This code path is live in production: Karta Platinum cards' NDEF URL
// template is `https://mobile.karta.cards/t/{urlCode}?e={PICCData}&m={CMAC}`
// (no cardRef), and the mobile app POSTs the `{e, m}` pair back here at
// every tap.  See apps/mobile/src/screens/tap/TapVerifyScreen.tsx.
//
// Complexity: O(N) per tap where N = active cards in the program.  Each
// iteration costs 1 AES-GCM decrypt (local) + 1 CMAC derivation (HSM call
// in prod, AES-CMAC in dev).  The HSM call is the dominant factor — assume
// ~10ms p50, so a program with 10k active cards is ~100s worst case.  There
// is NO way to lower this without putting the UID (or a UID-deriveable
// fingerprint) in the URL, which the privacy spec forbids.
//
// If a program's active-card count starts to matter, the cheap lever is an
// in-process LRU keyed by UID: same UID → same derived key, so we avoid the
// HSM round-trip on repeat taps.  The expensive lever is sharding the
// trial loop across workers.  Neither is in scope today.
//
// Filters to ACTIVATED + PROVISIONED only — SHIPPED cards have no business
// hitting this endpoint (their NDEF URL points at the activation flow, not at
// /t/<urlCode>), and SUSPENDED/REVOKED cards must be rejected upstream of any
// signed-handoff mint.
